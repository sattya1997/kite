# Manual Icon Setup Guide

## Quick Fix for Mobile Icons

Since the icon generator might not work, here's a manual approach:

### Step 1: Use Online Icon Generator
1. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload your `favicon-2.svg` file
3. Download the generated icon package
4. Extract and place PNG icons in your `public` folder

### Step 2: Alternative - Use Your Current SVG
Your current `manifest.json` should work better now. The key changes made:

- ✅ Fixed duplicate entries
- ✅ Added proper `purpose` attributes  
- ✅ Added `scope` and `orientation`
- ✅ Better mobile support

### Step 3: Test Your PWA
1. Open your app in mobile browser
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" option
3. Install the PWA and check if icon appears

### Step 4: If Still Blank Icons
Replace your `manifest.json` with `manifest-png.json` after generating PNG icons.

## Required Icon Sizes for Mobile:
- 16x16, 32x32 (browser tabs)
- 48x48 (Windows taskbar)  
- 72x72, 96x96 (Android home screen)
- 144x144 (iOS home screen)
- 152x152 (iOS splash screen)
- 192x192, 512x512 (PWA install icons)

## Current Status:
Your manifest.json has been updated with better mobile support. The SVG approach should work on most modern browsers, but PNG icons provide the best compatibility.
